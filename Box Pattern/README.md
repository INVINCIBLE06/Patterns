# Box Patterns

Welcome to the Box Patterns repository! Here, you will find various patterns organized in a square shape. The codes are done with both For "loop" and "While" loop. The patterns are further classified into the following categories:

1. Alphabetical Patterns: This category includes patterns composed of letters only.
2. Number Patterns: This category comprises patterns consisting of numbers only.
3. Symbol Patterns: This category contains patterns composed of symbols only.

Feel free to explore and showcase these patterns for your projects or personal use.
